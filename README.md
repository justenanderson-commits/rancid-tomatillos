# Rancid Tomatillos Partner Project
## Abstract:
This application allows users to browse through a display of 40 movies, each of which is clickable to view additional information about the movie. Text labels were added below each movie's image to maximize accessibility.

## Installation Instructions:
1. Go to [this repo](https://github.com/dgubko/rancid-tomatillos) on Github
2. Click Fork > Create New Fork
3. Click Code
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type git clone and paste the URL
7. Run `cd rancid-tomatillos`
8. Run `npm install`. Note: Do not run `npm audit fix --force`. This will update to the latest version of packages, which are not wanted. 
9. Run `npm start` to start the program. (`Ctrl + C` will stop it.)
10. In a browser window, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
11. The app should now ready to browse and search for recipes.  

## Context:
The team held daily standups and followed a kanban workflow using GitHub Projects. Meetings started by checking in with one another as humans. Then accomplishments from the day prior were discussed, what needed to be done that day and by whom, and then collaborative debugging or problem solving was completed (as needed). Some tasks were completed indivdually, others together. The collective estimate is about 50-60 hours of work time invested over 9 days to create this application's functionality and test suite from scratch using React. The Cypress was used for testing. Router provided the routing.
For accessability we chose large font and neutral, high-contrast colors. 100% Lighthouse Accessibility score.

## Learning Goals:
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Refactor your code to DRY up repetitive logic
- Practice talking about code and high level technical concepts
- Implement feedback to improve product and process

## Tech Used:
- React
- Cypress
- Router
- GitHub
- Terminal
- VS Code
- Chrome Browser/Dev tools + React dev tools
- Lighthouse
- Zoom
- JavaScript
- Slack
- Google Font API

## Wins and Challenges
Wins
- The Rancid Tomatillos api crashed on Thursday of week 2. The next day, tests that had passed were failing. Through some excellent collaborative problem-solving we were able to identify the problem, what needed to be fixed, and implement a solution. 

- In implementing the solution above, we also partially completed our learning goals for the weekend, in that Dmitrii was able to get some great practice with Cypress. The entire experience was organic and highly-effective for learning and problem solving.

- In general, we divided tasks effectively and completed them on time.

Challenges
- Cypress was quirky, at best and difficult at worst. It was laggy, crashed a few times, and tests failed intermittently. We found that restarting Cypress would clear failing tests and allow everything to pass. Like Cypress just needed to reset for everything to work.
